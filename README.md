# Welcome to your organization's demo respository
This code repository ("https://github.com/Madib036/Malesforfemales/blob/codespace-jubilant-space-yodel-576r946qqwpfvqpg/.github%2Fworkflows%2Fcodeql.yml") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency
